### Potential API issues
The spoonacular API has over 330,000 recipes but the application will only contain 
almost 600, the potential issue is randomizing the data properly so that

issue is extracting the exact ingredients from the recipe according to how many 
people to serve for the grocery list. For the twilio API verifying a phone number 
after registering.
